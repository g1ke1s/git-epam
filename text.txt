A computation is any type of arithmetic or non-arithmetic calculation that is well-defined.[1][2] Common examples of computation are mathematical equation solving and the execution of computer algorithms.

Mechanical or electronic devices (or, historically, people) that perform computations are known as computers. Computer science is a field that involves the study of computation.
